[System.Serializable]
// Serialization is the automatic process of transforming data structures or object states into a format thtat Unity can store and reconstruct later.

// Serialization is the process of converting an object into a stream of bytes to store the object or transmit it to memory, a database, or a file. Its main purpose is to save the state of an object in order to be able to recreate it when needed. The reverse process is called deserialization

// The serialization system is written in C++
